# Resturant-Website-Using-Bootstrap
Project Objective :
Build a responsive website for a restaurant where users can read
the details of the restaurant
Project Background:
You are a web developer at a service-based web
development company called Kite Technologies. The
company has been approached by a client who wants to
build a website for their restaurant named Ming’s Diner.
The website should provide the users a brief overview of
the restaurant and its bestsellers, its address, as well as
an option to contact the restaurant. During sprint
planning, you agree to lead this project and develop the
website.
The focus of this project is largely on the Visual elements
of the application and that should be your primary focus.
Business logic should only exist to the extent that it
supports visual experience for the user.
You must use the following:
● HTML: To define the content of the
website
● Bootstrap: To build the website (this is
required)
● JavaScript (Optional): To handle events
and responses
● JQuery (Optional): To include JavaScript
plugins like modals, tooltips, etc. (Use of
JQuery beyond that portion used for
bootstrap is optional.

Following requirements should
be met:

The text content is unimportant and lorem
ipsum is acceptable.
There is no no need for sever-side code in
the assigment.
The website should be responsive.
The website should have a carousel, a
navbar, a CTA button, a boostrap grid (as a
page layout function), and a footer.
The website should have a contact form.
(which doesn't need to actually do anything
other than confirm that the contact details
have been submitted.)
The CTA (Call To Action) button's functionality
can simply lead to another page on the site
such as ordering, menu, or contact. (Preferably
order or menu)
The focus of this project should be visual and
so application functionality such as contact
form, order page, etc should have only the
minimum business logic to support the visual
aspects of the page.
Form submittals such as contact or order don't
need to do anything beyond giving visual cues
to the user that hte form had been submitted.
There is no need to store any data or allow user
to query prior orders and/or contact details.
The source code should be pushed to your
GitHub repositories. You need to document the
steps and write the algorithms in the Google
Docs.
The link of your GitHub repository is must. In
order to track your task, you need to share the
link of the repository. You can add a section in
the Google Docs.
Document the step-by-step process involved in
completing this task.

Step by Step Process :

First I created an outline for this project, determining what
html pages would be necessary. I narrowed it down to, a
home page, a menu page, an order page, a contact page,
and a page to navigate to the other pages. First I used the
Bootstrap documentation to add it to all of the html pages. I
then added a nav bar to the top of all the pages for easier
navigation. Next, I added a short welcome paragraph for the
users, telling them about the restaurant. I then added the
carousel to the homepage, showcasing some images I
found of similar cuisine. I added a grid to the homepage
and added some temporary text with the Hours of
Operation, and Delivery information. Last, I added a call to
action button to a card placed at the bottom of the page. I
used the footer element of the card to satisfy that criteria as
well. This button takes the user to the menu page. I created
the contact form and filled it with questions asking the user
about their experience at the restaurant. I also created an
order page and added several items from a made up menu. I
added scripts for the submit buttons for both pages to alert
the user that their feedback or their order has been
submitted. On the menu page I found images of the menu of
an existing restaurant with a similar name. The pagination
page has buttons to access the other pages of the website
incase the user doesn’t want to use the nav bar.
